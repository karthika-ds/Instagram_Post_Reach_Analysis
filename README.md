# Analyzing Instagram Reach
Let’s start with analyzing the reach of my Instagram posts. I will first have a look at the distribution of impressions I have received from home

The impressions I get from the home section on Instagram shows how much my posts reach my followers. 
Looking at the impressions from home, I can say it’s hard to reach all my followers daily. 
Now let’s have a look at the distribution of the impressions I received from hashtags

Hashtags are tools we use to categorize our posts on Instagram so that we can reach more people based on the kind of content we are creating. 
Looking at hashtag impressions shows that not all posts can be reached using hashtags, but many new users can be reached from hashtags. 
Now let’s have a look at the distribution of impressions I have received from the explore section of Instagram

The explore section of Instagram is the recommendation system of Instagram. It recommends posts to the users based on their preferences and interests. 
By looking at the impressions I have received from the explore section, I can say that Instagram does not recommend our posts much to the users.
Some posts have received a good reach from the explore section, but it’s still very low compared to the reach I receive from hashtags.
Now let’s have a look at the percentage of impressions I get from various sources on Instagram
So the above donut plot shows that almost 50 per cent of the reach is from my followers, 38.1 per cent is from hashtags, 9.14 per cent is from the explore section, and 3.01 per cent is from other sources.

# Analyzing Content
Now let’s analyze the content of my Instagram posts. The dataset has two columns, namely caption and hashtags, which will help us understand the kind of content I post on Instagram.
Let’s create a wordcloud of the caption column to look at the most used words in the caption of my Instagram posts

# Analyzing Relationships
Now let’s analyze relationships to find the most important factors of our Instagram reach. It will also help us in understanding how the Instagram algorithm works.
here is a linear relationship between the number of times my post is saved and the reach of my Instagram post. 
Now let’s have a look at the correlation of all the columns with the Impressions column

# Analyzing Conversion Rate
In Instagram, conversation rate means how many followers you are getting from the number of profile visits from a post.
The formula that you can use to calculate conversion rate is (Follows/Profile Visits) * 100

# Instagram Reach Prediction Model
I will train a machine learning model to predict the reach of an Instagram post. Let’s split the data into training and test sets before training the model,
Now let’s predict the reach of an Instagram post by giving inputs to the machine learning model.
If a content creator wants to do well on Instagram in a long run, they have to look at the data of their Instagram reach. 
That is where the use of Data Science in social media comes in.
